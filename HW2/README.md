## How to run the Code:

You need two terminals open to run both the server and client.<br>
In one of your terminals: run `make`<br>
Then in the first of your terminals, to start the server: `make start`<br>
Finally in the second of the terminals, to get your quotes: `java QuoteClient <NUM OF QUOTES>`
