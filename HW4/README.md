## How to run the code:
Keep all the files in same folder; Scheduler.java, PCB.java, Algorothims.java, Main.java, config.txt, makefile.<br>
In the terminal type `make` for the java files to compile.<br>
Then type `java Driver <config file>`<br>
You can type `make clean` to delete all the *.class files<br>
My input file is called config.txt with 10 different Processes<br>
Test.txt is your example processes.
